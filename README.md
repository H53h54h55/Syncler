# Syncler
JSON provisioning file for Syncler+ apk

EXPRESS FILE

File containing a comprehensive list of sources that can be used by the Syncler+ app to scrape content titles. To avoid duplicate results, and increase performance, remove all other packages prior to install. Follow apk direction for installing Express packages ( see syncler.net ) or see below. The author by no way condones the use of this file to download or copy protected material and provides this file only as an example of how to create your own file. 

The aim with this file is to provide as many sources as possible in one repository. Whilst some may scoff that this is performance heavy there are those of us who prefer a thorough search and to know what sources are being searched.  You can always set 'Continue source search after source selection' to ON (Settings -> Source Resolving) if you want the search to continue in the background after you select a link.  

TO INSTALL
1) Goto - Settings -> Provider Packages -> Install (Express)
2) This will generate a code on screen xxxx-xxxx
3) On the web navigate to https://syncler.net/install

Sites are searched by Syncler in the following priority.  All returned results are prefixed 'Lobster-xxxxxx' so you can easily identify this provider packages results over any others you may have installed (although it is not recommended you install any other pacakges as this will result in performance issues and duplicates)
